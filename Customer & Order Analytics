#In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data.

#1. How many orders were placed in January?
SELECT COUNT(orderID) FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length (orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID'; 

#2. How many of those orders were for an iPhone?
SELECT COUNT(OrderID)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE Product = 'iPhone'
AND length(orderID) = 6 
AND orderID <> 'Order ID'; 

#3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February. 
SELECT DISTINCT cust.acctnum 
FROM BIT_DB.customers AS cust
INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales AS Feb
ON cust.order_id = Feb.orderID
WHERE length(Feb.orderID) = 6
And Feb.orderID <> 'Order ID'; 


#4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price? 
SELECT distinct Product, price FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE price IN (SELECT min(price)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales);

#5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?
SELECT sum(quantity)*price as revenue, product 
FROM Bit_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY product;

#6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
SELECT product, sum(quantity), sum(quantity)*price as revenue 
FROm BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location = "548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101"
GROUP BY product;

#7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time, and what was the average amount spent for those customers? 
SELECT  count(distinct acctnum), avg(quantity)*price 
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust
ON Feb.orderID = cust.order_id
WHERE quantity > 2 
AND length(orderID) = 6 
AND orderID <> 'Order ID'; 

#8. List all of the products sold in Los Angeles in February, and include how many of each were sold. 
SELECT product, SUM(quantity)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location like '%Los Angeles%'
